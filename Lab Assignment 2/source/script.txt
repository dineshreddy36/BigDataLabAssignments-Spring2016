K Means clustering on data set :  Educational Process Mining (EPM): A Learning Analytics Data Set


Assuming lab.csv is the test data

lab=read.csv("lab.csv")   // loading the data into lab variable

View(lab)      // Displays the data stored in lab

results<-kmeans(lab,3) //applying kmeans clustering algorithm on Lab data with k value as 3

results   //   displays the results after performing kmeans algorithm

results$size   // gives the size of clusters

results$cluster   //   gives the clustering vector for the results

plot(lab[c("Student.ID","TOTAL..100.points.")],col= results$cluster)   // plots the graph between two attributes differentiated by assigning each color to a cluster

plot(lab[c("ES.1.1...2.points.","ES.1.2...3.points.")],col= results$cluster)   // plots graph with a different pait of attributes from the input data grouping each cluster with a color
